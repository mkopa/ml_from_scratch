# Machine Learning From Scratch

## Introduction

This tutorial aims at explaining how deep neural networks work, starting from trivial examples
implemented using basic math all the way to solving real-life problem using deep convolutional networks.
It is dedicated to anyone who has basic mathematical knowledge and is fluent in Python
programming (experience in working with NumPy arrays will be very helpful).
The tutorial consists of 6 parts:

1. Short theoretical introduction
2. Solving trivial problem using basic math
3. Solving trivial problem using dedicated library (Theano)
4. Music genre prediction using Theano
5. Music genre prediction using Keras
6. More sophisticated music genre prediction using Keras

## Requirements

1. Python 2.7 with Theano and Keras packages installed
2. Classical music vs rock music data files (required):
